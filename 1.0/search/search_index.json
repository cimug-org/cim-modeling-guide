In the past a company would traditionally use a single software system, whether it is a custom in-house solution, or purchased from a large software company, and there would be a single proprietary data standard and format used. With the deregulation of the power industry and the emergence of smarter grids, there is now a greater need to be able to share such power system data between companies and systems.</p> <p>The increase in choice provided by the number of power system software vendors and the different software packages and architectures available add to the challenge of data exchange. These issues point to a requirement for a single, open standard for describing power system data and to aid the interoperability between software packages and exchange of information both within one company and between companies.</p> <p>The Common Information Model (CIM) is an open standard for representing power system components originally developed by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in North America. The CIM provides the basis of a series of standards developed under the auspices of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The CIM standard was started as part of the Control Centre Application Programming Interface (CCAPI) project at EPRI with the aim of defining a common definition for the components in power systems for use the Energy Management System (EMS) Application Programming Interface (API). The EMS API is now maintained by IEC Technical Committee 57 Working Group 13 as IEC 61970-301. The format has been adopted by the major EMS vendors to allow the exchange of data between their applications, independent of their internal software architecture or operating platform.<sup>1</sup></p>"},{"location":"#about-the-uca-international-cim-users-group","title":"About the UCA International CIM Users Group","text":"<p>The UCA International Users Group (UCAIug) is a not-for-profit corporation focused on assisting users and vendors in the deployment of standards for real-time applications for several industries with related requirements.

The model development process flow is shown in Figure 4\u20114. CIM Management is performed as part of the \u201cVerify Extended Model\u201d subprocess. Change Management The Change Management Process establishes an orderly and effective procedure for tracking the submission, coordination, review, evaluation, categorization of change requests, and approval for release of changes to CIM UML baselines. The Change Management Process is shown in Figure 4\u20115. Changes can either be modifications to existing model elements or the creation of new model elements. Document Generation The document generation process involves the creation of the document artifacts associated with the CIM. The CIM UML is used to create these documents as exemplified in Figure 4\u20116. CIM Profiles (including RDF and XML schemas) are generated by the IEC working groups. CIM Model Managers may assist working groups in creating RDF and XML schemas. All other artifacts under CIM Management are generated by CIM Model Managers.

These work items are subject to approval in accordance with the normal procedures before progressing to the preparatory stage. Proposal Stage The proposal stage is the first step in creating a new standard. During this stage a working group generates a proposal for new work. The output of this stage is a New Work Item Proposal (NWIP). The NWIP is submitted via a National Committee to the IEC and communicated to the members of the appropriate IEC CIM working group. Preparatory Stage <p>During this stage a Working Draft (WD) is prepared, generally by a project leader within a project team. The availability of working draft (if not supplied with the proposal) is 6 months.</p> <p>The preparatory stage ends when a working draft is available for circulation to the members of the technical committee or subcommittee as a first committee draft (CD) and is registered by the office of the CEO.</p> Committee Stage The committee stage is the principal stage at which comments from National Committees are taken into consideration, with a view to reaching consensus on the technical content. Enquiry Stage After addressing the comments received from national committees about the CD the working group then prepares an updated version of the standard that is issued as a Committee Draft for Vote (CDV). This is circulated to member countries for a five-month voting period and is considered approved if two thirds of the votes cast are in favor and the number of negative votes does not exceed 25% of the votes cast. At this stage countries may still submit comments along with their vote. Approval Stage <p>The working group, once again, addresses any comments that have been received and prepares a Final Draft International Standard (FDIS). This is submitted to the IEC Central Office and circulated to the national committees for a two-month voting period. At this stage a country may only make an explicit vote: positive, negative or abstention.</p> <p>The FDIS is approved if two thirds of the votes cast are in favor and the number of negative votes cast does not exceed 25% of the votes cast. If approved, the document is published however if the conditions are not met it is referred back to the working group to be revised. Final publication is the responsibility of the IEC Central Office and leads to the publication of an international standard.

An additional package is maintained outside of the IEC working group packages to describe the dependencies among the packages of each working group. This package, named \u201cPackageDependencies\u201d contains a figure illustrating these dependencies as shown in Figure 5-3 UML package dependencies (for illustration, not official CIM standard). As such the PackageDependencies package is itself dependent upon all the other major packages</p> <p>The package dependencies should rarely change and therefore it makes sense for the CIM model manager role to maintain this diagram through the normal model issues submittal process. There is no need for each package owner to edit this package. By design there are no circular dependencies among the major packages. Issues are resolved through the CMM board.</p> <p>The rule of CIM ownership is that any model linkages between packages are owned by the depending package. Thus any linkage (generalisation, association, dependency relationship, attribute type reference, or diagram reference) between e.g. IEC61968 and IEC61970 is owned by the IEC61968 package since it depends upon IEC61970. In CIM, we model associations as implicitly bi-directional, and this rule of package ownership applies to both ends of an association (i.e., for an association between e.g. IEC61968 and IEC61970, both association ends are owned by the IEC61968 package). This is the convention applicable to CIM model management regardless of UML association end ownership, which standard UML does not explicitly specify.</p> <p>Further we expect that derived classes (specialisations) are within the dependent package (e.g. cross package specialisations would be modelled within IEC61968 packages since IEC61968 depends upon IEC61970). Classes in a given package are allowed to specialise classes owned by packages upon which the given package depends.</p> <p>Additionally we prefer to have the source end of associations in the dependent package. This is not strictly required, but is a good practice and can be validated by the CIM validation tools used to generate the CIM documentation. Following this convention may allow shortcuts in reassembling combined models, but this is not a formally documented feature of Enterprise Architect.</p> <p>Diagrams should only include links to anything from packages upon which the containing package depends. Not following this practice will cause such linked elements to disappear when reassembling the combined model. This is the main reason for having the separate \u201cPackageDependencies\u201d package with its overview diagram from Figure 5-4. Importing this package last ensures that all the dependencies appear on the diagram when assembling the combined model from its partitions.</p> <p>When a model linkage spans working group packages, both parties should be aware of the linkage once models are combined. Such linkages should normally be discussed among working groups so that inappropriate linkages are not established. At this point any change that impacts that linkage should be agreed among the affected working groups.</p> <p>This coordination extends to any potentially inherited attributes and associations when the linkage is generalization. Namely, the class inheriting attributes and associations from its base class that is in another working group package depends on types used for attributes and association ends of the base class. Therefore, any change in the base class will impact all those that inherit from that base class.</p> <p>Types used for attributes in a class introduce dependencies that must be coordinated among the working groups as well.</p> RuleID Description Rule009 There shall be one and only one package in the CIM that describes the dependencies between the TC57 working group packages.

The package can be either obtained directly from the owner or indirectly from the owner. The additional rules are that we merge packages via the procedure in clause 2.2.2 and we must follow the guidance for model ownership of cross package linkages as defined in clause 2.2.4. We stamp each major package with a version revision stamp which is representative of the package (as defined by our ownership rules) in any combined model which has followed this process.</p> <p>The merging process can inadvertently change dependent models so care must be taken to not make changes that invalidate dependent models. For example if WG13 were to delete a class from which WG14 generalizes, that generalization owned by WG14 would be lost in any merge where the class was deleted.

For example import the Grid (formerly IEC61970) package before Enerprise (formerly IEC61968), and import PackageDependencies package last. At any point when assembling packages, the model will be complete in regards to anything owned by the imported packages according to the definition of ownership in clause 2.2.4.</p> <p>UML element Identity in Enterprise Architect UML is by internally generated GUID\u2019s. Thus it is not equivalent to delete something and then enter the same data again. Such an operation will break linkages in the model, though the source model appears identical from the user interface. In Enterprise Architect you can change the names without breaking linkages. Some tools rely upon the name of the class or attribute not the Enterprise Architect GUID values for reference matching and will break linkages if names are changed. Modelling actions should be aware of both implications.</p> <p>The best practice is to always import and work with the standard packages upon which your package depends so you get the proper GUID based linkages.</p> RuleID Description Rule018 Working group package assembly must start with an empty Enterprise Architect project containing a single empty model. Rule019 Packages must be first exported from a properly combined model and then imported into an empty Enterprise Architect project containing a single empty model in order to perform proper package assembly. Rule020 Packages may be exported in any order. Rule021 Package exportation must follow the procedure specified in Appendix TBD. Rule022 <p>The integrity of internally generated GUIDs for Enterprise Architect model elements must be preserved between model versions to ensure model integrity.</p> <p>NOTE:: Some tools rely upon the name of the class or attribute not the Enterprise Architect GUID values for reference matching and will break linkages if names are changed.</p> Rule023 Package assembly must be performed by importing packages in dependency order as defined in the PackageDependencies diagram shown in Figure 5\u20113. Specifically, the package import order is: <ol><li>Grid (formerly IEC61970);</li><li>Enterprise (formerly IEC61968);</li><li>Market (formerly IEC6235);</li><li>PackageDependencies.</li></ol> Rule024 <p>After each package import, the package dependency rules specified in Section 5.2.3 must be satisfied.</p> <p>NOTE: Any cross-working group package associations to packages not yet imported will be discarded in the combined model as they are by definition not owned by the thus far imported packages.</p>"},{"location":"section5-cim-uml-modeling-rules-and-recommendations/#package-rules","title":"Package Rules","text":"<p>The purpose of packages in the CIM model is mainly for controlling working group ownership, with sub-packages mainly representing conceptual organization.

For example, the Domain and Core packages are ordered first in the UML. The printed documentation will use this package ordering.

Note that this will apply to all packages that start with this prefix (e.g., 'InfCore' as well as 'Informative').</p> <p>The content of the informative package, including any sub-packages and its content, recursively, is considered as informative in the sense of IEC documents and is therefore by default excluded from the document generation.

Only classes describing domain objects, i.e. classes without data type stereotypes such as &lt;&lt;enumeration&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;Primitive&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;Compound&gt;&gt;, or &lt;&lt;CIMDatatype&gt;&gt;, may participate in associations.</p> <p>An association has two ends referred to as association ends. CIM associations have unspecified direction but have both ends specified which means they are implicitly bi-directional (i.e., it is possible, through end names, to navigate from A to B and from B to A).</p> <p>The association description and association name are not specified. These become a maintenance problem if specified and also show up on diagrams by default. Instead, we specify the association end names and descriptions.</p> <p>The UML association features used in CIM are as follows:</p> <p>Stereotype &lt;&lt;informative&gt;&gt;, only in case the association is informative. No other stereotypes are allowed.</p> <p>The UML association end features used in CIM are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Association end name;</p> </li> <li> <p>Association end multiplicity;</p> </li> <li> <p>Association end description.</p> </li> </ul> <p>No other options should be used, although some association ends in CIM are defined as aggregation (= shared).</p> <p>Note that, depending on local user settings for EA tool:</p> <p>it may happen to create by default a directed association, so ensure that the direction for association and both its ends is \u201cUnspecified\u201d;</p> <p>if using aggregation from the toolbox, the diamond may be on unexpected side of relationship, so always create first a simple association.</p> <p>Furthermore, to facilitate the correct dependency processing (see 2.2.2), draw an association from a class in the depending package (source end) towards a class in the dependent package (target end). For example, an association between a class in \"Enterprise\" (formerly the \"IEC61968\" package) and a class within \"Grid\" (formerly the \"IEC61970\" package) would be drawn from (the source end of) the class defined within \"Enterprise\" towards (the target end of) the class within \"Grid\". This since \"Enterprise\" depends upon the \"Grid\" package.</p> <p>There appears to be no clear manner to control the association end ordering (within the context of a class) in the Enterprise Architect tool so this is an unmanaged aspect of the UML model. In fact, UML does not specify association ends are owned by the class, they are by default owned by the association itself.</p> <p>Association end names should be unique among all specialisations of a class. For example, if IdentifiedObject associates to the Name class with an end name of \u201cName\u201d, no specialisation of IdentifiedObject may create another association whose end name is \u201cName\u201d regardless of the class to which it associates. Note that any number of associations from other classes may use the same name (e.g. \u201cIdentifiedObject\u201d) as the association end name on the IdentifiedObject end of the association, as long as the prior rule of uniqueness among specializations is respected.</p> <p>Multiplicities are used to describe the number of expected objects at each end of an association as well as if an attribute is optional or mandatory. The following multiplicities are common for association ends in CIM:</p> <ul> <li> <p>0..1 an object may or may not exist,</p> </li> <li> <p>1 an object always exists,</p> </li> <li> <p>0..* any number of objects may exist,</p> </li> <li> <p>1..* at least one object exists.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Multiplicities shall be chosen to specify what can be expected in the domain. Multiplicity minimum does not mean all profiles must include the association, but if a profile does include the association it should respect the minimum.
