# CIM Management Tools

This section gives a brief description of the software tools used to help carry out the responsibilities of CIM Management.

## Sparx Enterprise Architect

Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect modeling tool is the tool used to maintain the CIM UML. CIM Management leverages the tool support for partitioning a model into several model files, which allows working groups to develop top-level package model content separately, and then merge the model changes into a complete version of the CIM UML.

Enterprise Architect can also be used to generate CIM Profiles with its Schema Composer tool.

## CIMTool

CIMTool is an open source tool for working with the CIM to produce design artifacts such as database schemas, RDF Schema, XSD Schema, JSON Schema, source code classes, reference documentation, etc. from a contextual profile.

## jCleanCim

jCleanCim is a Java application that is used to auto generate draft model standards from the CIM UML. It uses a Word document template, a configuration file, and a CIM UML project file to create the 61970-301, 61968-11, and 62325-301 model documents.

## CIMug Website

The CIMug website serves as the tool that provides online access to artifacts under CIM Management. The CIMug website provides unrestricted access to the CIM UML and controlled access (security credentials required) to artifacts that fall under the Liason D relationship UCA has with the IEC.
